# Calculator
A project that contains a functional calculator with 3 different toggleable themes

## Description
A fun challenging project I created that implemented a variety of elements
- Responsive - Using css grid layout to create a good user experiance on all devices
- Interactive buttons - Creating a complete and intuitive design using multiple stylesheets controlled by JS
- Themes - Multiple themes allowing the user to choose what suits them
- Maths logic - Using JS to create the functioning logic

## Further Improvements
In the future I may add a feature to save the users favourite theme in local storage
